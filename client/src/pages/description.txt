we created a rest api to interact with the server

we can get or post to some routes (or endpoints) and get informaton back or create stuff



for example 

GET /users/1 returns the information for the user with id 1



Describe the architecture of your application?
We created an SPA client application using react.
We created a REST api to interact with the server.
We created a relation database (mysql) to persist the information

How does the server work?
We defined routes for the REST api endpoints.
Then we have controllers that handle requests for the routes.
The controlers intereact with the database through models (sequelize).
And send the response back from the controllers in json format.

How does the client work?
It's a SPA. We have one html file that loads the javascript. Then we use react
and react router for the UI. And we use axios to send REST api requests
to the server.

What's your data model for your relational database?
TODO

- what tables to you have?
- what are the columns in your tables
- what are the relationships (foreign keys and such)
